# Odin Recipes Project Summary

## Overview
The Odin Recipes project is a simple website showcasing various recipes, consisting of an index page and individual recipe pages.

## Iteration 1: Initial Structure
- Created `index.html` with boilerplate HTML and an `<h1>` heading "Odin Recipes".

## Iteration 2: Recipe Page
- Created a `recipes` directory and added `lasagna.html` with an `<h1>` for the recipe name.

## Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
- Enhanced `lasagna.html` with:
  - An image of the dish.
  - A description.
  - An unordered list of ingredients.
  - An ordered list of preparation steps.

## Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
- Created additional recipe pages: `spaghetti.html` and `pizza.html`.
- Updated `index.html` with links to all recipes in an unordered list.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how to structure a basic HTML website with multiple pages, using headings, images, lists, and links.

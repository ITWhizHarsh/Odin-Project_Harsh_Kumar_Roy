# Elements and Tags

## Introduction
- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Defines the structure and content of webpages, creating elements like paragraphs, headings, lists, images, and links.

## Elements and Tags Overview
- **HTML Tags**: Mark the start and end of an element in a webpage.
- **Opening Tag**: Enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., `<p>`, tells the browser this is the start of an element.
- **Closing Tag**: Same as the opening tag but with a `/`, e.g., `</p>`, marks the end of an element.

### Example of a Paragraph Element

`<p>some text content</p>`

- `<p>`: Opening tag.
- some text content: Content between the tags.
- `</p>`: Closing tag.

## Key Points

- Elements: Contain content, defined by the opening and closing tags, that the browser formats.
- Semantic HTML: Using the correct HTML tags for content, which improves search engine rankings and accessibility.

## Void Elements

- Void Elements: Tags without closing elements, e.g., `<br>` or `<img>`.
- Self-Closing Tags: A form of void elements with a slash, e.g., `<br />` or `<img />`. Modern HTML discourages these, but browsers still render them.
